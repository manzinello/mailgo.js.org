Multiple email address are supported, at the moment only with the default installation, so only for links `href="mailto:..."` (less-spam installation with multiple email addresses is not supported yet)

```html
<a href="mailto:info@mailgo.dev,matteomanzinello@gmail.com"
  >two email addresses in mailto</a
>
```

<a href="mailto:info@mailgo.dev,matteomanzinello@gmail.com">two email addresses in mailto</a>
